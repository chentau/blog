		<p>My name is Tony Chen, and I’m currently a junior at Boston College, studying psychology, math and computer science, and I’m blogging about my learning process through the fields of statistics and machine learning.  Since I believe that the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else, its my hope that writing about these topics will help me gain a more complete understanding of them, since the majority of my knowledge is self taught.  In addition, starting this blog will hopefully motivate me to learn more (I have a terrible habit of starting things and leaving them halfway through).</p>

<p>As such, this blog is mainly for my sake, although I hope I didn’t discourage you from reading further.  Most of the posts will be shamelessly ripped from some other resource, and so I’ll include references whenever possible.  I intend for each post to serve as a notebook of sorts, each one consisting of an exploration/introduction to some self contained topic.</p>

<p>With all that said, lets get started!  I should also note that the aesthetics of this blog was influenced heavily by Dustin Tran’s blog and NIPS formatting.</p>
